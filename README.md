# hello-world
James here, aka kibs, which is a short for my middle name Kibin, or short for kibbles n' bits.
I'm just a designer with llama hair trying to learning git.
I was raised on kimchi & fried chicken.
Ate cup of noodles to fuel my dreaded taekwondo classes.
Went to baseball practices to get capri-suns and oreos.
Went to design school where I learned how to turn drawing things into a $$$.
Needed to experience the northeast and escape fried chicken for a bit.
Went to Intrepid. 
Came to ezCater.
